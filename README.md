A fork of: 

## Addon Manager Fix Micro

Original documentation: 

- https://github.com/Ulf3000/addon_manager_fix_micro#readme

This fork is: 

- primarily for compatibility with editions of Mozilla's **Add-on Compatibility Reporter** – [forked by me](https://github.com/grahamperrin/e10s-compatibility-alerts) but not yet changed, intended to simply alert end users (not to report to Mozilla)
- for me to experiment with changes to style – https://github.com/grahamperrin/addon_manager_fix_micro/tree/style
- broadly envisaged to be one part of a two-extension bundle that might partially address [e10s, multi-process: Waterfox add-on compatibility reporting · Issue #401 · MrAlex94/Waterfox](https://github.com/MrAlex94/Waterfox/issues/401).

Background (from [e10s (multi-process) compatibility reports at addons.mozilla.org (AMO)](https://gist.github.com/grahamperrin/12e03fe3d305901c093cb68bce43fe92)):

> [Waterfox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/) previously allowed an automated switch to single-process mode, in response to adding (or enabling) any extension that is incompatible with multi-process. This [automation ended with Waterfox 56.0.3](https://github.com/MrAlex94/Waterfox/commit/6e345976571abe1b99cddc2b718de1f50af5c4cb).

– the absence of automation drove the wish for compatibility reporting ([issue 401](https://github.com/MrAlex94/Waterfox/issues/401)).
